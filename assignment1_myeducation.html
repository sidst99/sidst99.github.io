<p id="head">What My Education Means To Me</p>
<p class="text">Education is one of the most important aspects in my life. I work my hardest during school so that I am successful when I grow up. My goal is to be an independent woman and to reach that goal I need proper schooling. I feel as though my education is what keeps me on the right track. I have ambition to get to college one day and this ambition helps me stay focused and do well in school. I know that the more education you have the better your career will be so I feel that working very hard right now will most definitely pay off in the long run. With education I will be the hardworking woman I was destined to be.</p>
<p class="text">My goals in life are all based around a good, well-earned education. When I grow up I aspire to have a PhD in Psychology. To reach this goal I will have to get at least a 3.9 throughout my high school career so I can make it into one of the college that I dream about. These colleges are either Duke University or the University of Michigan. At these schools I will major in psychology. This will lead me onto my career of being a psychologist and help me reach my goals of being successful. It is true that as I am within my career I will never stop my education. I will always continue to take class so that I am caught up on the latest research that has to deal with the psychological aspects of a human being. My education is one of the most important things I need to succeed.</p>
