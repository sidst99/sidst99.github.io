<p id="head">Becoming A Psychologist</p>
<img src="future.jpg" />
<p class="text">One of my greatest goals in life is to become a Psychologist. I know I will be able to do this because I have the ambition and drive it takes to accomplish this. The reasoning for me wanting to become a Psychologist is that I have a passion for understanding the way the human brain works and I feel that I can take that and help others cope with their psychological set backs. In order to achieve this though I must go through an extensive amount of schooling and training. In order to reach a point where I can open my own facility I must attend college for a near minimum of 8 years. In that case I would have my PhD in Psychology and would have the knowledge it takes to help others in my own personal environment.</p>
<p class="text">Having a PhD in Psychology opens your doors to many different types on careers in psychology. Those with PhD s have the opportunity to not only open their own practice but to also work as a counselor, educator, or researcher. If someone did choose the route of having their own practice they would have to accommodate patients by working evening or weekend hours. The starting salary for a person with a PhD in Psychology ranges anywhere from $30,000-$75,000. The main part of being a psychologist is that by doing research and performing examinations, psychologists study all aspects of the mind. Psychologist have to be emotionally stable and must put themselves in their patients shoes so they can understand what they are going through. But, most of all, psychologists must have a passion to help people.</p>
